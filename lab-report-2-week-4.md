## Process

>For these two labs, our objective was to make a program that takes all the links in a markdown file and print them out. Our group was given a basic java file that worked for ideal conditions, but we were supposed to make it work for other unusual cases as well. We worked together in our group on the code, and only some people commited certain parts of the code, so the github commits that I will be showing is from one of my groupmates' fork of the markdown-parse repo.
