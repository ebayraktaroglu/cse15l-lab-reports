# Week 2 Lab Report
1. Step 1: Installing Visual Code Studio

> I had already installed Visual Code Studio for my CSE 11 class last quarter, so I didn't really do anything for this step.

2. Step 2: Remotely Connecting

> Since I am working on a Windows laptop, I had to follow the extra steps to install OpenSSH Client and OpenSSH Server. I checked and saw that I already had OpenSSH Client on my laptop, so I thought I was done and ignored all the other necessary steps. This caused problems later on during the lab. But I was still able to remotely connect to the ieng6 server after resetting my password and waiting for the password to update.
> 
> Later, outside the lab, I OpenSSH Server as well. I was getting some errors with the commands I needed to run, and I realized this was because wasn't opening VSCode as an administrator. I researched how to do that, and then the commands worked.

3. Step 3: Trying Some Commands
> I connected remotely to the server, then tried some of the commands. I used ls to see the files and directories, then used pwd to see the name of the directory, then used that info to change the directory to perl5. There was nothing in there. I then tried commands on my own computer. I used the ls command, and it worked a little differently than it did on the linux os, but it did show the directories. I used the pwd command, got the directory name, and added \Downloads to change directory (using cd) to Downloads.
